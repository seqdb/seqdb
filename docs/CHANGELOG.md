## [v0.2.4](https://github.com/seqdb/seqdb/releases/tag/v0.2.4) - 2025-08-19

### Changed
- **Enhanced truncation functionality**: Completely refactored [`truncate_if_needed_()` method](https://github.com/seqdb/seqdb/blob/v0.2.4/crates/vecdb/src/traits/generic.rs#L277-L311) in Generic trait to allow truncation even with pending changes, holes, or updates, enabling more flexible vector state management
- **Intelligent data cleanup during truncation**: Enhanced truncation logic to automatically clean up holes and updates that would be affected by the truncation, maintaining data consistency while allowing operations previously blocked by the clean state requirement
- **Improved rollback validation**: Added [`stamp comparison check`](https://github.com/seqdb/seqdb/blob/v0.2.4/crates/vecdb/src/traits/generic.rs#L443-L445) in `rollback_before()` method to prevent unnecessary rollback operations when the current stamp is already earlier than the target stamp

### Removed
- **Simplified RawVec implementation**: Removed redundant [`truncate_if_needed()` override](https://github.com/seqdb/seqdb/blob/v0.2.4/crates/vecdb/src/variants/raw/mod.rs#L436-L447) from RawVec variant, allowing it to inherit the improved generic implementation and reducing code duplication

### Technical Implementation
- **Smart truncation logic**: The enhanced truncation method now:
  - Calculates total vector length including both stored and pushed data (`len = stored_len + pushed_len`)
  - Returns early if truncation index is beyond current length (no-op case)
  - Automatically filters holes to remove entries beyond truncation point using `retain(|&i| i < index)`
  - Cleans up updates affecting indices beyond truncation using `retain(|&i, _| i < index)`
  - Handles pushed data truncation intelligently - clearing all pushed data if truncating within stored range, or partially truncating pushed data if truncating within pushed range
- **Optimized rollback efficiency**: Added early exit condition in `rollback_before()` to avoid unnecessary file system operations when the target stamp is already in the future relative to current vector state

### Breaking Changes
- **Truncation behavior**: `truncate_if_needed_()` no longer requires vectors to be in a clean/flushed state before truncation, potentially changing behavior for code that relied on the previous strict validation

### Dependencies
- Updated all workspace package versions from 0.2.3 to 0.2.4 across seqdb, vecdb, and vecdb_derive crates
- Maintained external dependency stability while updating internal version references

- **Advanced rollback functionality**: Added [`rollback_before(stamp)` method](https://github.com/seqdb/seqdb/blob/v0.2.2/crates/vecdb/src/traits/generic.rs#L425-L451) in Generic trait with sophisticated file system-based rollback logic for rolling back to specific timestamps with automatic stamp validation

### Changed
- **Simplified rollback API**: Replaced complex `rollback_stamp(stamp)` with streamlined [`rollback()` method](https://github.com/seqdb/seqdb/blob/v0.2.2/crates/vecdb/src/traits/generic.rs#L453-L459) in Generic trait that automatically uses the current vector's stamp for easier usage and reduced API surface
- **Enhanced rollback example demonstrations**: Completely updated [raw example](https://github.com/seqdb/seqdb/blob/v0.2.2/crates/vecdb/examples/raw.rs) to showcase the new simplified rollback API with comprehensive scenarios including multi-step rollback operations and complex state management

### Technical Implementation
- **Intelligent stamp-based rollback**: The `rollback_before(stamp)` method implements sophisticated directory traversal logic that:
  - Scans the changes directory for all available stamp files
  - Creates a ordered map of stamps to file paths using `BTreeMap<Stamp, PathBuf>`
  - Iterates backwards through stamps using `range(..=self.stamp()).next_back()`
  - Validates stamp consistency with current vector state before each rollback operation
  - Returns the final stamp reached after rollback completion
- **Simplified rollback operation**: The new `rollback()` method eliminates the need to specify stamps by automatically reading the change file corresponding to the current vector's stamp, making rollback operations more intuitive and less error-prone
- **Robust error handling**: Enhanced stamp validation ensures that change files match expected vector stamps before performing rollback operations, preventing data corruption from mismatched state files

### Breaking Changes
- **Rollback method signature**: Changed from `rollback_stamp(stamp: Stamp) -> Result<()>` to `rollback() -> Result<()>` for the simple rollback case
- **Enhanced rollback return type**: `rollback_before()` now returns `Result<Stamp>` instead of `Result<()>`, providing feedback on the final stamp state after rollback

### Dependencies
- Updated all workspace package versions from 0.2.1 to 0.2.2 across seqdb, vecdb, and vecdb_derive crates
- Maintained external dependency stability while updating internal version references

### Added
- **Advanced dual-input transformation method**: Added [`compute_transform2()` method](https://github.com/seqdb/seqdb/blob/v0.1.2/crates/vecdb/src/variants/eager.rs#L154) in EagerVec for sophisticated transformations involving two input vectors simultaneously
- **Multi-vector computational support**: Enhanced analytical capabilities by enabling transformations that can process data from two different vectors alongside the current vector's state

### Technical Implementation
- **Complex transformation function signature**: The `compute_transform2()` method accepts a closure with signature `FnMut((A, B, C, &Self)) -> (I, T)` where:
  - `A` is the shared index type across vectors
  - `B` and `C` are the data types from the two input vectors
  - `&Self` provides access to the current eager vector's state
  - Returns tuple `(I, T)` for target index and transformed value
- **Version-based computation validation**: Implements sophisticated version tracking using `Version::ZERO + self.inner_version() + other1.version() + other2.version()` to ensure computational consistency across all involved vectors
- **Intelligent iteration coordination**: Synchronizes iteration across multiple vectors using `iter_at(index)` with coordinated advancement, ensuring data alignment and proper handling of vector boundaries
- **Generic constraint system**: Enforces type safety through comprehensive generic bounds ensuring `A: StoredIndex`, `B: StoredRaw`, `C: StoredRaw` for robust type checking at compile time
- **Safe memory access patterns**: Uses `unwrap_get_inner(a)` and `into_owned()` for efficient and safe data access across the involved vectors during transformation

### Performance Characteristics
- **Optimized dual-vector processing**: Minimal overhead for coordinating iteration across two input vectors while maintaining memory safety
