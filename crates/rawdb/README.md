# rawdb

A very simple filesystem like storage engine that provides storage with dynamic region management.

## What is rawdb?

rawdb is a lightweight storage engine designed for applications that need to store and retrieve data in named regions on disk. It provides:

- **Dynamic region management** with automatic resizing and defragmentation
- **Sequential writes** optimized for append-heavy workloads
- **Hole punching** to reclaim unused disk space
- **Thread-safe operations** using parking_lot locks

## Key Features

- **Named regions**: Store data in logical regions identified by strings or numbers
- **Automatic space management**: Regions grow dynamically and can be moved/defragmented
- **Cross-platform hole punching**: Supports Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD
- **Thread-safe**: Concurrent access using RwLocks

## Core Types

- **`Database`**: Main entry point for database operations
- **`Identifier`**: Region identifier (string or number)
- **`Reader`**: Zero-copy reader for region data
- **`Region`**: Metadata about storage regions

## Storage Model

rawdb organizes data into regions within a single file. Each region has:
- **Start offset**: Position in the file (page-aligned)
- **Length**: Current data size
- **Reserved space**: Allocated space (≥ length, page-aligned)

Regions can grow automatically and are moved/defragmented as needed for efficient space utilization.
